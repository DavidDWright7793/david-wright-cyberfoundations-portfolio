# Week 8 Lab 05 — Log In with a Key

**Student Name:** David Wright

**Date Completed:** 9/14/2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-05-log-in-with-a-key.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Authorize the public key created in Lab 03 and prove that `analyst@localhost` authenticates with that key without falling back to the account password.

## What You Already Know

In Week 6, SSH used the `analyst` account password. Here, the server stores the public key in `authorized_keys`, while the private key stays in the client account. The same user, protocol, and destination remain; only the authentication method changes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**Required prerequisite:** Complete Lab 03 first.

**[TERMINAL] Run:** whoami, cf-week8-check, test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Does the private key need to be copied into `authorized_keys`? Explain.

```text
A private key should not be copied into 'authorized_keys'. A private key is designed to be known to only the owner, and is never sent to a server-it stays on the client machine. It is a public key that is meant to be coped into 'authorized_keys', as a public key is meant to be freely available to others so they can communicate securely with the file's owner.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare `authorized_keys`

**[TERMINAL] Run:** mkdir -p ~/.ssh, chmod 700 ~/.ssh, touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 2 — Add the Week 8 Public Key Once

**[TERMINAL] Run:** grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```bash
grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This command adds the key only if an identical line is not already present.

### Step 3 — Confirm the Entry and Safe Permissions

**[TERMINAL] Run:** grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```bash
grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Required result:** The count is `1`; permissions show `700` for `.ssh` and `600` for `authorized_keys`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab05-authorized-key-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Run the Public-Key-Only Proof

**[TERMINAL] Run:** ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'

```bash
ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'
```

If SSH asks whether to trust the host fingerprint, type `yes` and press Enter. If no fingerprint question appears, continue; `localhost` was already known. Do not delete `known_hosts` to force the question.

At `Enter passphrase for key`, enter the **Lab 03 key passphrase**. Do not enter the `analyst` account password.

**Required result:** AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS analyst cf-student-XX

```text
AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS
analyst
cf-student-XX
```

The final hostname will contain your assigned VM number instead of `XX`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the three result lines as `week08-lab05-publickey-auth-success.png`.

## Stop & Check

If the command asks for the `analyst` account password, reports `Permission denied`, or does not print `AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS`, do not submit. The options in the proof command disable account-password fallback for this one test only; they do not change the VM server.

### Troubleshooting

1. Run `grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required value is `1`.
2. Run `stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required values are `700` and `600`.
3. Run `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub`; it must show the Lab 03 key.
4. If any check fails, stop and contact the instructor. Do not edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, use `sudo`, disable password authentication, or delete `known_hosts`.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, compare Week 6 password authentication with this key-based test. State what changed and what stayed the same.

```text
In Week 6, I used SSH to connect to the analyst account on the VM at 'localhost' with a password. In Week 8, the SSH protocol, analyst account, and VM destination at 'localhost' all stayed the same. The server still held what it needed to verify me. However, the method of authentication for Week 8 changed. I was required to present proof of possession of a private key rather than a password.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What changed between the Week 6 and Week 8 SSH logins?

```text
The method of authentication changed between the Week 6 and Week 8 SSH logins. I presented a password to login in Week 6, whereas I presented proof of possession of a private key to login in Week 8.
```

2. What stayed the same?

```text
In Week 6, the SSH protocol, analyst account, and VM destination at 'localhost' all remained the same, and the server still held what it needed to verify me.
```

3. Why does `authorized_keys` contain the public key rather than the private key?

```text
The 'authorized_keys' file is on a server and lists public keys that are allowed to authenticate for a given account. Private keys are meant to never leave the owner's machine and to never be known to anyone but the owner.
```

4. Why is the forced proof stronger evidence than a normal successful SSH login?

```text
Forcing public-key-only authentication demonstrates that the key method was used. A successful login does not prove that in and of itself.
```

5. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

```text
The key passphrase is different from the 'analyst' account password because they guard different things. The key passphrase protects the private key file on disk, and the account password authenticates to the account-they are separate.
```
